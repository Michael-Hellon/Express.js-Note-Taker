# Express.js-Note-Taker

## Description

This project was to create an application called Note Taker. The user will be able to write and save notes and then delete them once completed. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON, using the fs module. This project will be deployed to Render. I used nodemon for debugging and a UUID to create unique ids assigned to the note as they are created and added to the list. 

- My motivation was to create a note taking app that allowed the user to create, save and delete notes as needed. I wanted to use GET, POST, and DELETE request and routes to gain experience using them.
- I built this project so that my client and others could utilize a simple Note Taking App that would allow them to create, save and delete notes without using an actual database.
- This project solved the problem of being able to create, save and delete notes utilizing the appropriate routes, without using an actual database.
- I learned a lot from this project. I learned how to use GET, POST and DELETE routes to access information in a JSON object.
